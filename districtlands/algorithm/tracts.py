'''

this file includes methods to fetch census tracts and deal with them

currently, there is just one method: get_all_tracts(), which fetches
all the census tracts, adds their adjacencies, and returns them as a dictionary

CHANGELOG
Dorothy Carter - 20171107 - initial creation of script
Dorothy Carter - 20171110 - cast population to int
